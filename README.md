It's a very simple blog created to test some libs which works with django and pratice some django and docker, docker compose.

## Run the project:
- create a copy of <em>.env.dev</em> and name it as: <em>.env</em>
- run the following command: <em> docker compose up -d</em>
- obs: notice that we use boot.sh that runs migrations right after web container is up.

## TODO:
 - [] Improve blog's design
 - [] create tests for views
 - [] copy search bar to homepage
